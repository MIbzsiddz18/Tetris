This project was done as part of the Object Oriented Programming Techniques course. 

The code is written in C++, and makes use of the raylib library for the graphics. The program is compiled using the terminal. 

The game features a standard tetris grid, a tab to show the incoming block, and a scorecard to keep track. A random number generator defines which block is to be generated next. 

The arrow keys on the keyboard are used to control the horizontal movement, rotation, and vertical drop of the block. The game ends when the piled blocks reach the max height of the grid.
